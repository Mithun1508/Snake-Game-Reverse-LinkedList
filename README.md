# Reverse a LinkedList Snake Game Project 

# Goal of the Project:
1)Basically in the snake Game you're a snake on a 2D Board and usually you see a kind of outlines of the Squares int the board .you control the sanke and you've to eat the food that kind of randomly appears on the screen .There is a little like gear icon/flower icon and Whenever you eat the food your sanke gets bigger .Suppose if you hit the wall or your own tail for example your body you'll lose just to know to get a high score as possible  
2)second of all looped and ate my own body and So I died yeah thats what i am try to build 

# COMPONENTS:
Vanilla JS ,Pure React
I used create React App and npm package 

# Workflow:
Basically I have an App component here there comes our main app file and there it renders the board and there will be an Empty component where all of our code is going to go and I got the board CSS file and it serves as the Background the color of the Background so if I put in my board something like foo bar then you go to the foo bar and precreated an util File Where copy and pasted the function to generate a random Number from an interval in js which got from stackoverflow whene to trying to figure out the fn pops up on the board and close out these app.js and index.js files that rernders the app all we gonna be working on with the board file 
1) Let's jump into it and create a board with the 2D grid .Basically I created a board variable in react so its going to be a state variable you know need to access it very easily update it or Something it basically craetes a new 2d  Array I got a constant for the size of an array so right now we are creating 10 * 10 board Guess it will be 100 cells then I iterate over the board mapping every row to an element
